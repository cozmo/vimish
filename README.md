# Vimish
Vimish is a [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that emulates many features of Vim.
Additionally, it has an experimental EasyMotion/Jumpy like support.

It is still a work in progress and is probably broken in a lot of ways. The code is also in rough shape but hopefully
that will improve over time.

## Unsupported things that hopefully will be supported one day

* The 'repeat' command (currently works in a very limited capacity)
* Visual Line Mode
* Complex registers
* More correct cross-file marks
* Search motions
* More Vim accurate undo
* Custom keybindings
* A maintainable codebase, maybe even tests.

## Unsupported things that will probably never be supported

* Ex commands
* Visual Block Mode
* Motions/commands relating to the screen (unless VSCode adds support for this in the extension API)

## Contributing

Feel free to make issues for bugs or feature requests, or submit PRs in GitHub. As this is a hobbyist project
maintained by one person, I can't promise any timeline on when issues will be solved.
